  intro: [
    "Hello! I am Brandon, a career-changer and recent graduate from Oregon State University.",
    "I started my professional career working as a Registered Dietitian, serving Veterans at the Department of Veterans Affairs. When the Covid \
    pandemic struck, I found myself with little to do and created a personal challenge to 'learn something new everyday'. This led me to discover Computer Science and I eventually\
    started creating interactive web-based games using P5.js. From there I was hooked! I found myself learning and writing code nearly everyday. After a few months I realized \
    that I had found my passion and decided to start my career-change journey.",
    "During my return to school, I continued working full time as a Dietitian and, following my first quarter, I realized that my love for CS was \
    leading me to help many of my peers. I was getting a lot of joy connecting with and helping \
    other students so I decided to take on a part-time role as a Teaching Assistant.",
    "Currently, I am looking for a full-time role as a software engineer. While searching, I continue to build my skillset \
    by working on projects and learning new technologies. I also have taken and passed my AWS Associate Developer Certification exam and continue \
    to practice building distributed applications using AWS cloud services.",
    "When not working on projects, I enjoy being outdoors cross-country skiing, hiking, or paddleboarding. I also love to \
    cook and am a big fan of anime and personal finance.",
